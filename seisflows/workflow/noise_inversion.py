    Noise Inversion Workflow
    ------------------------


    Parameters
    ----------
    :type modules: list of module
    :param modules: instantiated SeisFlows modules which should have been
        generated by the function `seisflows.config.import_seisflows` with a
        parameter file generated by seisflows.configure
    :type data_case: str
    :param data_case: How to address 'data' in the workflow, available options:
        'data': real data will be provided by the user in
        `path_data/{source_name}` in the same format that the solver will
        produce synthetics (controlled by `solver.format`) OR
        synthetic': 'data' will be generated as synthetic seismograms using
        a target model provided in `path_model_true`. If None, workflow will
        not attempt to generate data.
    :type stop_after: str
    :param stop_after: optional name of task in task list (use
        `seisflows print tasks` to get task list for given workflow) to stop
        workflow after, allowing user to prematurely stop a workflow to explore
        intermediate results or debug.
    :type export_traces: bool
    :param export_traces: export all waveforms that are generated by the
        external solver to `path_output`. If False, solver traces stored in
        scratch may be discarded at any time in the workflow
    :type export_residuals: bool
    :param export_residuals: export all residuals (data-synthetic misfit) that
        are generated by the external solver to `path_output`. If False,
        residuals stored in scratch may be discarded at any time in the 
        workflow

    Paths
    -----
    :type workdir: str
    :param workdir: working directory in which to perform a SeisFlows workflow.
        SeisFlows internal directory structure will be created here. Default cwd
    :type path_output: str
    :param path_output: path to directory used for permanent storage on disk.
        Results and exported scratch files are saved here.
    :type path_data: str
    :param path_data: path to any externally stored data required by the solver
    :type path_state_file: str
    :param path_state_file: path to a text file used to track the current
        status of a workflow (i.e., what functions have already been completed),
        used for checkpointing and resuming workflows
    :type path_model_init: str
    :param path_model_init: path to the starting model used to calculate the
        initial misfit. Must match the expected `solver_io` format.
    :type path_model_true: str
    :param path_model_true: path to a target model if `case`=='synthetic' and
        a set of synthetic 'observations' are required for workflow.
    :type path_eval_grad: str
    :param path_eval_grad: scratch path to store files for gradient evaluation,
        including models, kernels, gradient and residuals.
