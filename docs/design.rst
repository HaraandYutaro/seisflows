Design Philosophy
=================================

.. note::
   Page Under Construction

Although SeisFlows was written with 'Pythonic' style in mind, there are some 
design choices within the internal structure of the package that may be unique 
to SeisFlows. Throughout this documentation page we point out some of these 
choices, and provide detail on why and how they were implemented. This page is 
intended for developers and super users who want to explore the source code 
deeply or edit/extend SeisFlows for other purposes.
