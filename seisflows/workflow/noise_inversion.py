    Noise Inversion Workflow
    ------------------------
    Run forward and adjoint solvers to produce Synthetic Greens Functions (SGF)
    based on unidirectional forces which are meant to represent virtual
    sources of uniform noise distributions. SGFs are compred to Empirical
    Greens Functions (EGF) for iterative model updates.

    Parameters
    ----------
    :type kernels: str
    :param kernels: comma-separated list of kernels to generate w.r.t available
        EGF data. Corresponding data must be available. Available options are:

        - 'ZZ': vertical component force recorded on vertical component.
          Represents Rayleigh wave energy
        - 'TT': transverse copmonent force recorded on transverse component.
          Represents Love wave energy
        - 'RR': radial component force recorded on radial component.
          Represents Rayleigh wave energy

        Example input would be `kernels`='ZZ,TT'. Case insensitive
