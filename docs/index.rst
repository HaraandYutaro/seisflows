SeisFlows3
=====================================

SeisFlows is a Python waveform inversion package with a growing user base in 
academia and industry. So far, the package has been used for production runs 
with a billion or so model parameters and for research on oil and gas 
exploration, earthquake seismology, and general nonlinear optimization problems.

SeisFlows3 is the Python3 upgrade of SeisFlows, and includes enhanced command
line interfacing with the package, as well as integration with the external
earthquake tomography misfit assessment package Pyatoa.
