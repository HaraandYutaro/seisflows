SeisFlows is a Python-based waveform inversion package used to tackle the problems of full waveform inversion, seismic migration, and adjoint tomography.  
                                                                                 
With a growing user base in academia and industry, this package has been used for production scale inversions, some with over a billion model parameters, for research problems related to oil and gas exploration, earthquake seismology, and general nonlinear optimization problems.                                         
                                                                                 
Recent changes made with respect to the original SeisFlows code (now named SeisFlows Legacy): include code refactor to Python3, improvements in source-code implementation and readability, stronger adherance to coding standards (PEP-8), and additional functionalities including a command line tool and improved parameter input system.
