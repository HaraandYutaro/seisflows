"""
Ambient Noise Adjoint Tomography Forward Solver based on the workflow proposed
by Wang et al. where synthetic Greens functinos (SGF) are generated by
simulating point forces.

.. note:: Kernel Naming

    The kernel naming convention used for naming in this workflow follows from
    reference 1 and follows from the ambient noise community. The convention is
    two letter names (e.g., AB) where the first letter (e.g., A) represents the
    input force direction, and the second letter (e.g., B) represents the
    component on which the wavefield is recorded. So ZZ represents an
    upward (+Z) force recorded on Z components. In ambient noise, the
    common EGFs are ZZ, TT and RR.

    Noise Inversion Workflow
    ------------------------
    Run forward and adjoint solvers to produce Synthetic Greens Functions (SGF)
    based on unidirectional forces which are meant to represent virtual
    sources of uniform noise distributions. SGFs are compared to Empirical
    Greens Functions (EGF) for iterative model updates.

    .. note:: simulation requirements per source station

        - 'ZZ' kernel requires 1 forward (Z) and 1 adjoint (Z) simulation
        - 'TT or RR' kernel requires 2 forward (N + E) and 2 adjoint (N_? + E_?)
           simulations (where ? = R or T)
        - 'TT,RR' kernels can share their 2 forward simulations (N + E) but
          require 4 separate adjoint simulations (N_T + E_T + N_R + E_R)
        - 'ZZ,TT or ZZ,RR' requires 3 forward (Z + N + E) and 3 adjoint
        - 'ZZ,TT,RR' requires 3 forward (Z + N + E) and 5 adjoint
           (Z + N_T + E_T + N_R + E_R)

    Parameters
    ----------
    :type kernels: str
    :param kernels: comma-separated list of kernels to generate w.r.t available
        EGF data. Corresponding data must be available. Available options are:

        - 'ZZ': vertical component force recorded on vertical component.
          Represents Rayleigh wave energy
        - 'TT': transverse copmonent force recorded on transverse component.
          Represents Love wave energy
        - 'RR': radial component force recorded on radial component.
          Represents Rayleigh wave energy

        Example inputs would be 'ZZ' or 'ZZ,TT' or 'ZZ,TT,RR'. Case insensitive
