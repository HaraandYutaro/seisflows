    "\n",
    "In this example SeisFlows already contains a Slurm system module, and has overriding sub-classes for Slurm-derived systems including Chinook (University of Alaska Fairbanks), Maui (New Zealand eScience\n",

    "Below we provide some examples of editing existing SeisFlows modules for modified performance. We'll first start off with a modified Slurm system which defines SeisFlows interaction with Maui, a New Zealand cluster."
