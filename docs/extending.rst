Extending SeisFlows
==================================

.. note::
    Page Under Construction

The design philosophy of SeisFlows is such that being a user of the codebase
more-than-likely requires also becoming a developer, as custom-made subclasses
are often required to tailor the functionalities of SeisFlows to a specific
problem, compute system, dataset, etc. This page is intended to provide an
outline on how to successfully implement your own base- or subclasses within
the SeisFlows framework.
